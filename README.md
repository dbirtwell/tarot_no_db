# Tarot App - NO DB

A simple Sinatra application WITHOUT database access.

The "meanings" are read from a local text file.

It was created as a learning and proof-of-concept project and is not expected to be beautiful by amy means

This is the version I pushed to Heroku initially. Other versions will follow.

This version uses haml for the views.
Database storage for data will be added to future versions, as well as tests.

This is just the beginning!

The running version of thison Heroku can be found at:

NOTE:

This is based upon several resources I discovered on the internet.
I will add resource links links when I update the project.
